 Use if statements to help the Blackjack dealer determine who won.

int house and player variables are declared and initialized. 

Use the following rules of blackjack to print out the result:

if the player score is bigger than 21, the result is "player bust"

if the player score is equal to the house score, the result is "its a tie"

if the player score is equal to 21, the result is "player win"

if the house score is bigger than the player score, the result is "player lose"

if the player score is bigger than the house score, the result is "player win"

    EX:
    Input:
    house is 8, player is 21
        Output:
            player win

    house is 10, player is 7
        Output:
             player lose

    house is 4, player is 4
        Output:
              its a tie

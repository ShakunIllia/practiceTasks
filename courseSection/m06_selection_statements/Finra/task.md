Given integer variable **number**,

For a number that is a divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FINRA" instead of the number.

For a number that is a divisible by 3, print "FIN" instead of the number.

For a number that is a divisible by 5, print "RA" instead of the number.

Otherwise, print out the number

    Example:
        number is 15 => "FINRA" is printed
        number is 10 => "RA" is printed
        number is 9 => "FIN" is printed
        number is 11 => "11" is printed

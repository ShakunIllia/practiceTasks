<div class="hint" title="Practice topics">
  <i style="padding-left: 40px;">if statements, primitive variables, operators</i>
</div>

Use `if statements` to help the student find out which grade level they will join based on their `age`.
Use the following information to determine the results:

```
less than 3   -> ineligible
3-4           -> preschool
5             -> kindergarten
6-10          -> elementary school
11-13         -> middle school
14-18         -> high school
19+           -> college
```


    Ex:
    age is  8
    Output:
    elementary
    
    age is  5
    Output:
    kindergarten

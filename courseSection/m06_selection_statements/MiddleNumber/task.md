Given integer variables **first, second, third**, write code to find out middle number
and assign to **middle** integer variable

_Numbers will not be equal for this task._

    first is 5, second is 10, third is 7
    Output:
        middle number = 7

    first is 12, second is 10, third is 44
    Output:
    middle number = 12

 Pizza Order Program

You're making a program to calculate the cost of a pizza order.

You're given three pieces of information: the pizza size (size),
whether extra pepperoni should be added (addPepperoni), and whether extra cheese should be added
(extraCheese). 

Your goal is to calculate the total price of the pizza order.

Menu Prices

    Small pizza (S): $13.99
    Medium pizza (M): $15.99
    Large pizza (L): $18.79

**Additional Costs**

    If addPepperoni is 'Y':
        Small pizza: +$1.50
        Medium pizza: +$1.90
        Large pizza: +$2.10
    If extraCheese is 'Y':
        Small pizza: +$1.25
        Medium pizza: +$1.65
        Large pizza: +$2.00

Calculate Total Price
_The total price will be the sum of the pizza size price and any additional costs for extra toppings._

    Examples:
    
    Example 1:
        Size: Large (L)
        Add Pepperoni: Yes (Y)
        Extra Cheese: Yes (Y)
        total price: $22.89
    Example 2:
        Size: Small (S)
        Add Pepperoni: No (N)
        Extra Cheese: Yes (Y)
        total price: $15.24
    Example 3:
        Size: Medium (M)
        Add Pepperoni: No (N)
        Extra Cheese: No (N)
        total price: $15.99
    Your program should calculate the total price according to these rules and print the total price.

 Given the integer variables soldYesterday and soldToday, 

Write an if/else statement that compares the value of the
variables soldYesterday and soldToday, 

and based upon that comparison assigns salesTrend the value -1 or 1.

1 represents the case where soldToday is equal or greater than soldYesterday.

-1 represents the case where soldToday is less than soldYesterday.

    Ex:
    soldYesterday is 92, soldToday is 105
    Output:
    salesTrend = 1
    
    soldYesterday is 44, soldToday is 12
    Output:
    salesTrend = -1

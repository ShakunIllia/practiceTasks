 Given the integer variables speedLimit and currentSpeed, Write an if/else statement that calculates ticketAmount:

If currentSpeed is more than speedLimit, ticketAmount is **$6** for each mile over the limit plus **$51** processing fee.

if speeding, print out the result as below:
    ticketAmount = $183

If not speeding:
    Not speeding

    Ex:
    speedLimit is 55, currentSpeed is 85
    Output:
    ticketAmount = $231
    
    speedLimit is 55, currentSpeed is 50
    Output:
    Not speeding

  <i style="padding-left: 40px;">milesOverLimit * 6 + 51</i>

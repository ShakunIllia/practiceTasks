<div class="hint" title="Practice topics">
  <i style="padding-left: 40px;">loops</i>
</div>

Use a `loop` to print the alphabet from `A` to `Z`. Print all the characters in one line, with no spaces between them.

Also use another `loop` to print the alphabet from `z` to `a`. Print all the character in one line, with no spaces between them.

Note: There will be two lines in the output. One of the uppercase letters from `A` to `Z`, and a second line for the lowercase letter from `z` to `a`.

_Note: Do not just print the characters as a String, use a loop to iterate through all the characters_

    Example Flow:

    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

<div class="hint">
  <i style="padding-left: 40px;">for (char c = 'A'; c <= 'Z'; c++) ...</i>
</div>

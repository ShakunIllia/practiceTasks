<div class="hint" title="Practice topics">
  <i style="padding-left: 40px;">loops</i>
</div>

Use a `loop` to print all the even numbers from `1` to `20`. Print each number on the same line, with spaces between each

Use another `loop` to print all the odd numbers from `1` to `20`. Print each number on the same line, with spaces between each

    Note: In the end there will be two lines. First the line to show all the even numbers and then another line to show all the odd numbers

        Example Flow:
        2 4 6 .... 18 20
        1 3 5 .... 17 19

<div class="hint">
  <i style="padding-left: 40px;"> (i % 2 == 0)</i>
</div>

Use a `loop` to calculate the factorial of the given number `n`. 

In mathematics a `factorial` number is a positive integer that is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to the `n` number.

It is commonly written as `n!` In other words, a factorial value is the number multiplied to the number less than it, multiplied by the number less than it, repeating until 1. 

See the examples for clarification.

    Ex:
      Input:
        5
      Output:
        120
      -> The calculation would be:
        5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

    Ex:
      Input:
        8
      Output:
        40320
      -> The calculation would be:
        8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40320

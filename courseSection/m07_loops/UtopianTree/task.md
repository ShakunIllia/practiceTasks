Complete the `loop` to track the growth of the Utopian Tree. 

The tree grows exactly 1 cm for the first three years `(year<=3)`, and then afterward it grows by 2 cm every year.

Show the growth of the tree each year up to year 10. See the example flow below.

     Use the format:
     year x - growth x cm
     tree size: x cm

     where the 'x' values are different values of year, the growth amount, and the total tree size up to that year

     Output:
     year 1 - growth 1 cm
     tree size: 1 cm
     year 2 - growth 1 cm
     tree size: 2 cm
     year 3  - growth 1 cm
     tree size: 3 cm
     year 4 - growth 2 cm
     tree size: 5 cm
     year 5 - growth 2 cm
     tree size: 7 cm

     ... until you reach year 10
<div class="hint">
  <i style="padding-left: 40px;">add if statement for growth size(1 or 2), then add to treeSize</i>

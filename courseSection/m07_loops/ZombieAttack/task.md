There is a zombie disease pandemic wiping out populations. Use a `loop` to keep track of the city's population.

The starting population is given as the `inhabitants` value. Each day the city is losing half of its population.

Write the program that will show the population day by day, until the city gets to zero.

        Ex:
          Input:
            6

          Output:
            Day 0 [6]
            Day 1 [3]
            Day 2 [1]
            ---- EXTINCT ----

        Ex:
          Input:
            20

          Output:
            Day 0 [20]
            Day 1 [10]
            Day 2 [5]
            Day 3 [2]
            Day 4 [1]
            ---- EXTINCT ----

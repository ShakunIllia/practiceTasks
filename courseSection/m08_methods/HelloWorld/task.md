There are two static methods defined. 

Finish the methods to get the expected outcome.
Then call them in the main method.

These are void methods with no parameters

    - the `hello()` method should print the text `Hello`
    - the `world()` method should print the text `World!`

    - When the methods are called in the main method they will display a final message of:
        Hello
        World!

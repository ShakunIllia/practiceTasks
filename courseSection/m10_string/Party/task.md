Complete a `loop` and `Scanner` to create a guest list for the party.
Ask the user to enter the full name of the guest, store the name into the guest list and
ask if they want to enter another guest name.

    - If the user says `yes` then ask them for the next guest's name and repeat the process
    - If the user says `no` then stop asking for names and display the final guest list

    Make sure that there are no duplicate names. 

    Example Flows:
        Please enter the guest's name:
          Nick Cage
        Do you want to enter another guest's name?
          yes
        Please enter the guest's name:
          Linda Rosy
        Do you want to enter another guest's name?
          no
        Guests' list: Nick Cage, Linda Rosy

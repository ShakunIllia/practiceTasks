Finish the method called `refuels()` that will take an `ArrayList<Integer>` argument `deliveries` and an `int` `gasTank`.
The method returns an `int` for the number of refuels needed. The given values in `deliveries`
tells the amount of fuel needed for each delivery and the `gasTank` argument define the max capacity of fuel the car can hold.

Use all the given information to determine how much total times the driver will need to stop to refuel.
The `refuels()` method is already called in the main method with an argument.

    Examples
        refuels([7,7,7],7) -> 3
        refuels([9,1],3) -> 4
        refuels([100,200,10],10) -> 31

Finish the `calculateSales`() method that will accept an ArrayList of Double.

Each number will be the total sales amount for one branch of the company.
The company had a goal to earn a total of 5,000,000 in sales this year.
Return true if the company reached their goal and false if they did not.

There was also another goal that no individual branch earned less than 30,000,
so if any one branch earned less than 30,000 then the company still did not reach their goal no matter how much the total was.

    Examples
        calculateSales(300000, 200000, 250000, 250000) -> false
        calculateSales(300000, 200000, 250000, 1000000, 1500000) -> true
        calculateSales(3000000, 5000, 250000, 1000000, 3500000) -> false

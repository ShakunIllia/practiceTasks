Finish the method called `swap()` that will take an `ArrayList<String>` argument `list` and two `int` numbers `pos1` and `pos2`.
The method returns an `ArrayList<String>` which has the elements at indexes `pos1` and pos2` swapped.
     Swapping means they will change positions in the ArrayList and all other elements will remain untouched.
     The `swap()` method is already called in the main method with an argument.

    Examples
        swap(["one","two","three"],0,2) -> ["three","two","one"]
        swap(["a","c","b","d","e"],0,3) -> ["d","c","b","a","e"]
